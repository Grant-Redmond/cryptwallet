### Welcome to CRYPT. A simple and clean Bitcoin wallet.

This is a simple and clean Bitcoin wallet. An frictionless way to connect to the bitcoin blockchain, receive a wallet address and backup code, and start storing and sending bitcoins.

We never touch or hold on to any funds. CRYPT simply connects you to the Bitcoin blockchain and provides you with a GUI and keys. All transactions and storage are handled by the decentralized ledger of the Bitcoin blockchain.

Built With Java 8 on IntelliJ Community Edition using BitcoinJ

CRYPT IS IN DEVELOPMENT.

Feel free to clone and submit any suggestions/changes. 

Should work fine in your IDE. I'm currently unable to export to an executable file.

If anyone knows how to clean up all the bitcoinJ files and dependencies, that would be pretty helpful :)

**This is our first public release**; so download, install and give CRYPT a spin. We'd love to hear your feedback, if you run into any errors, or want any functionality additions!

Currently CRYPT Wallet is only available for Windows. We plan on releasing OSX and Linux versions soon.

**Again, this is a Beta**, so only move and store small amounts until final release!

Developers and people interested in contributing, feel free to make a branch and play around. 

Enjoy CRYPT!
