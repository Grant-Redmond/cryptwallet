### Welcome to CRYPT. A simple and clean Bitcoin wallet.

This is a simple and clean Bitcoin wallet. An frictionless way to connect to the bitcoin blockchain, receive a wallet address and backup code, and start storing and sending bitcoins.

* We never touch or hold any of your funds
* CRYPT simply connects you to the Bitcoin blockchain and provides you with your unqiue private Bitcoin key & phrase that are stored locally on your computer (meaning we never see or have access to it)
* If we were to ever go down or cease to exist, you can simply input your recovery phrase into another wallet and access your Bitcoin funds
* We never require you to input any personal information, emails or passwords
*All transactions and storage are handled by the decentralized ledger of the Bitcoin blockchain.

As soon as you install, we recommened writting down you unique recovery phrase located in settings. As long as you have this written down, you will always be able to retrieve your Bitcoins. Even if you accidentally delete or uninstall your wallet.

Windows Users (We Installs To The C:/ Directory To Avoid Having To Run As Administrator. If You Change Directory Installation To Program Files, You Will Need To Run CRYPT As Administrator Or Else You'll Receive And Error "Access Denied")

CRYPT Will Check For & Prompt You To Update As We Roll Out New Versions.

Built With Love In Java 8 on IntelliJ Community Edition using the [BitcoinJ Library](https://github.com/bitcoinj/bitcoinj)


Feel free to clone and submit any suggestions/changes. 

Should work fine in your IDE. I'm currently unable to export to an executable file.

If anyone knows how to clean up all the bitcoinJ files and dependencies, that would be pretty helpful :)

**This is our first public release**; so download, install and give CRYPT a spin. We'd love to hear your feedback, if you run into any errors, or want any functionality additions!

Currently CRYPT Wallet is only available for Windows. We plan on releasing OSX and Linux versions soon.

**Again, this is a Beta**, so only move and store small amounts until final release!

Developers and people interested in contributing, feel free to make a branch and play around. 

Enjoy CRYPT!
